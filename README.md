# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<br>

<p style="text-align:center;">
I am currently doing studies on FERIT in the city of Osijek in Croatia.
There is still so much for me to learn and I want you to know that the IT branch is
a completely "new thing" to me. For now, I don't have major projects that I can share with
you except my final assignment "Bank Management System" and some Java assignment from this semester.
I hope you enjoy it!
