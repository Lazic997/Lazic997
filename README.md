# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<br>

<img src="https://github.com/Lazic997/Lazic997/blob/main/pc.png" align="right" width="400" height="300"> 
I am currently doing studies on FERIT in the city of Osijek in Croatia.<br>
There is still so much for me to learn and I want you to know that the IT branch<br> is
a completely "new thing" to me. For now, I don't have major projects that I can <br>share with
you except my final assignment "Bank Management System" and some <br>Java assignment from this semester.<br><br>
I hope you enjoy it!
